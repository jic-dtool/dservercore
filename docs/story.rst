*dtool* and *dserver*
=====================

This document illustrates design decisions for
the *dserver* REST API, for our implementation and for the condensation
of several fundamental extensions.

In the following, we present user stories of stereotypical actors in the
academic world to: (1) summarise the essence of *dtool*
:cite:`olsson2019lightweight; (2) distil the need for,
and basic requirements on, *dserver*; (3) motivate design decisions for
our implementation of *dserver*.
