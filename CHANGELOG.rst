TODO
^^^^

- Simplify code cleaning up created_at and frozen_at types
- Replace get_json for use of the request argument directly
- Create response schemas

Added
^^^^^

- Integrated openapi
- Pagination for all listing endpoints
- Defined schemas for endpoint arguments
- Missing and improved docstrings for endpoints

Changed
^^^^^^^

- The frozen_at and created_at fields for /dataset/register endpoint are string representation of the floating point
  value. Previously the application was permissive and accepted any integer, float or string type. The type sanitation
  shall happen in the API client.

Changed
^^^^^^^

- Moved ``iter_datasets_in_base_uri`` from ``dtool_lookup_server.utils`` to ``dtoolcore``

Fixed
^^^^^

- Fixed issues registering datasets with "too much" metadata, resulting in datasets
  information JSON documents that were too large for the mongo database. These datasets
  are now ignored. See
  `issue 16 <https://github.com/jic-dtool/dtool-lookup-server/issues/16>`_
  for more information:



[0.15.0] - 2020-10-15
---------------------

This release makes it possible to create plugins to the dtool-lookup-server!

Many thanks to `Johannes L. Hï¿½rmann <https://github.com/jotelha>`_ and `Lars
Pastewka <https://github.com/pastewka>`_ for bug reports, design discussions
and code contributions.

Added
^^^^^

- Added hook to allow the loading of plugins. Scaffold code for implementing a
  plugin can be found in
  https://github.com/IMTEK-Simulation/dtool-lookup-server-plugin-scaffolding.
  For examples of actual plugins see:
  https://github.com/IMTEK-Simulation/dtool-lookup-server-dependency-graph-plugin
  and
  https://github.com/IMTEK-Simulation/dtool-lookup-server-plugin-scaffolding
- Added /config route; see
  https://github.com/jic-dtool/dtool-lookup-server/pull/6
- Added ability to filter searches by UUID by supplying ``uuids`` keyword and list of
  UUIDs of interest to a query submitted to the /dataset/search route; see
  https://github.com/jic-dtool/dtool-lookup-server/pull/8
- Added dtool_lookup_server.utils.preprocess_query_base_uris helper function; see
  https://github.com/jic-dtool/dtool-lookup-server/pull/7 and
  https://github.com/jic-dtool/dtool-lookup-server/issues/10

Fixed
^^^^^

- Fixed timestamps returned form /dataset/search route; they are now returned
  as floats rather than as strings; see
  https://github.com/jic-dtool/dtool-lookup-server/issues/3
- Fixed defect in ``flask user token`` CLI command when using python3; see
  https://github.com/jic-dtool/dtool-lookup-server/pull/5


[0.14.1] - 2020-04-02
---------------------

Fixed
^^^^^

- Made /dataset/summary route able to cope with individual datasets in the
  mongo database missing the tags key


[0.14.0] - 2020-04-01
---------------------

Added
^^^^^

- Added "tags" and "datasets_per_tag" keys to JSON response from
  /dataset/summary route
- Added ability to filter/search based on tags


Changed
^^^^^^^

- Registering a dataset now requires a key for ``tags`` in the JSON
  content


[0.13.0] - 2020-03-10
---------------------

Added
^^^^^

- Added /dataset/annotations route to which one can POST a URI and get back the
  associated dataset annotations


Changed
^^^^^^^

- Registering a dataset now requires a key for ``annotations`` in the JSON
  content
- The /dataset/search route no longer returns manifest and readme in the body
  of the JSON response. These will now have to be retrieved using the
  /dataset/manifest and /dataset/readme routes respectively. This change was
  implemented to overcome the slow response time when accessing many (>1000)
  datasets using the /dataset/search route. 

Fixed
^^^^^

- Made registration of datasets more tolerant to type of frozen_at in
  admin_metadata, now accepts value as a string


[0.12.0] - 2020-02-27
---------------------

Added
^^^^^

- Added /dataset/manifest route to which one can POST a URI and get back the
  associated dataset manifest
- Added /dataset/readme route to which one can POST a URI and get back the
  associated dataset readme


[0.11.0] - 2019-07-08
---------------------

Added
^^^^^

- Ability to log request headers in debug mode


[0.10.0] - 2019-06-14
---------------------

Changed
^^^^^^^

- Added logic to config.Config that ignores ``JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`` and
  ``JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE`` if ``JWT_PUBLIC_KEY`` is set in the environment.
  This makes it easier to configure the ``dtool-lookup-server`` to make use
  of tokens generated from another server. In other words where the private
  key file is maintained in a different service.


[0.9.0] - 2019-06-06
--------------------

Changed
^^^^^^^

- Improved the JSON query format when sending POST requests to the
  /dataset/search route


[0.8.0] - 2019-06-03

[0.7.1] - 2019-05-09
--------------------

--------------------

Added
^^^^^

- Added ``frozen_at`` column to admin metadata stored in SQL table
- Added ``created_at`` column to admin metadata stored in SQL table
- Added Ansible provisioning script to git repository


Changed
^^^^^^^

- ``dtool_lookup_server.utils.dataset_info_is_valid()`` helper function now
  returns false if "frozen_at" is missing.


Fixed
^^^^^

- Made /dataset/register route more robust if base URI has not been registered



[0.6.0] - 2019-05-02
--------------------

  AJAX possible
