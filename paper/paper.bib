  abstract = {The GridFTP extensions to the File Transfer Protocol define a general-purpose mechanism for secure, reliable, high-performance data movement. We report here on the Globus striped GridFTP framework, a set of client and server libraries designed to support the construction of data-intensive tools and applications. We describe the design of both this framework and a striped GridFTP server constructed within the framework. We show that this server is faster than other FTP servers in both single-process and striped configurations, achieving, for example, speeds of 27.3 Gbit/s memory-to-memory and 17 Gbit/s disk-to-disk over a 60 millisecond round trip time, 30 Gbit/s network. In another experiment, we show that the server can support 1800 concurrent clients without excessive load. We argue that this combination of performance and modular structure make the Globus GridFTP framework both a good foundation on which to build tools and applications, and a unique testbed for the study of innovative data management techniques and network protocols.},

This paper includes a review of various versioning strategies including forward-delta, reverse-delta and content-addressable mechanisms, the pro's and cons of each, and highlights the relative advantages of the Moab design.  In our approach, the fixity information of a file manifestation is used as its primary identifier and the filename is treated as metadata.  Storage and retrieval of an object's files is faciliated by mapping between a virtual version inventory and the physical location via a file signature catalog.},

As a way to overcome these challenges, we further develop the proposals by early Internet pioneers for Digital Objects as encapsulations of data and metadata made accessible by persistent identifiers. In the past decade, this concept was revisited by various groups within the Research Data Alliance and put in the context of the FAIR Guiding Principles for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable data. The basic components of a FAIR Digital Object (FDO) as a self-contained, typed, machine-actionable data package are explained. A survey of use cases has indicated the growing interest of research communities in FDO solutions. We conclude that the FDO concept has the potential to act as the interoperable federative core of a hyperinfrastructure initiative such as the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).},

In order to ensure that this need helps rather than hinders scientific work, the implementation of the FAIR-data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) must not be too narrow. Besides, the wider materials-science community ought to agree on the strategies to tackle the challenges that are specific to its data, both from computations and experiments. In this paper, we present the result of the discussions held at the workshop on ``Shared Metadata and Data Formats for Big-Data Driven Materials Science''. We start from an operative definition of metadata, and the features that~ a FAIR-compliant metadata schema should have. We will mainly focus on computational materials-science data and propose a constructive approach for the FAIRification of the (meta)data related to ground-state and excited-states calculations, potential-energy sampling, and generalized workflows. Finally, challenges with the FAIRification of experimental (meta)data and materials-science ontologies are presented together with an outlook of how to meet them.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

Deep learning does, however, have the potential to reduce the reproducibility of scientific results. Model outputs are critically dependent on the data and processing approach used to initially generate the model, but this provenance information is usually lost during model training. To avoid a future reproducibility crisis, we need to improve our deep-learning model management. The FAIR principles for data stewardship and software/workflow implementation give excellent high-level guidance on ensuring effective reuse of data and software. We suggest some specific guidelines for the generation and use of deep-learning models in science and explain how these relate to the FAIR principles. We then present dtoolAI, a Python package that we have developed to implement these guidelines. The package implements automatic capture of provenance information during model training and simplifies model distribution.},

The derivation of the Reynolds equation is based on explicit assumptions about the constitutive behavior of the fluid that prohibit applications in multiscale scenarios based on measured or atomistically simulated data. Here, we present a method that treats the macroscopic flow evolution and the calculation of local cross-film stresses as separate yet coupled problems---the so-called macro and micro problem. The macro problem considers mass and momentum balance for compressible fluids in a height-averaged sense and is solved using a time-explicit finite-volume scheme. Analytical solutions for the micro problem are derived for common constitutive laws and implemented into the Height-averaged Navier--Stokes (HANS) solver. We demonstrate the validity of our solver on examples, including mass-conserving cavitation, inertial effects, wall slip, and non-Newtonian fluids. The presented method is not limited to these fixed-form relations and may therefore be useful for testing constitutive relations obtained from experiment or simulation.},

  abstract = {Reibung und Schmierung sind Multiskalenprobleme, d.h. Prozesse auf unterschiedlichen Zeit- und L\"angenskalen beeinflussen einander und bestimmen die makroskopische Antwort eines Systems. F\"ur Schmierungsprozesse trifft dies insbesondere im Grenzreibungsbereich zu, in dem die Dicke des Schmierspalts in der Gr\"o\ss enordnung molekularer Interaktionsl\"angen liegt. Makroskopische Schmierungsmodellierung basiert fast ausschlie\ss lich auf der Anwendung der Reynoldsgleichung, w\"ahrend auf atomarer Skala vermehrt Molekulardynamik-Simulationen in den Vordergrund treten. Multiskalenmethoden f\"ur Schmierungsph\"anomene, die \"uber sequentielle Ans\"atze hinausgehen, sind bisher noch nicht etabliert. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wird ein Multiskalenansatz vorgestellt, welcher die L\"osung der makroskopischen Bilanzgleichungen in ein Mikro- und Makroproblem aufteilt. Das Makroproblem entsteht durch Mittelung der Bilanzgleichungen \"uber der Spalth\"ohe, \"ahnlich zur konventionellen Reynoldsgleichung, und wird mittels expliziter Finite-Volumen-Diskretisierung gel\"ost, w\"ahrend das Mikroproblem das konstitutive Verhalten des Schmierfilms enth\"alt. Die numerische Implementierung des Makroproblems wird mithilfe gew\"ohnlicher Konstitutivgesetze validiert und anhand konkreter Beispiele wird gezeigt, dass diese in Zukunft durch Molekulardynamik-Simulationen ersetzt werden k\"onnen. Au\ss erdem lassen sich analytische L\"osungen der linearisierten Grundgleichungen des Makroproblems herleiten, die mit Autokorrelationsfunktionen fluktuierender Zustandsvariablen aus Molekulardynamik-Simulationen verglichen werden. Daraus ergibt sich eine Methode zur simultanen Bestimmung von Viskosit\"at und Schlupfl\"ange aus Gleichgewichts-Simulationen, sowie die Beschreibung des \"uberkritischen Schalltransports in Fluidspalten. F\"ur eine effiziente Umsetzung des vorgestellten Multiskalenansatzes wird eine Ersatzmodellierung ben\"otigt, die zwischen einzelnen Mikrosimulationen interpoliert. Anhand von einfachen Beispielen wird das Anwendungspotential der Gau\ss prozess-Regression als m\"ogliches Ersatzmodell evaluiert. Die vorliegende Arbeit liefert somit die theoretischen Grundlagen einer simultanen Multiskalensimulation von Schmierungsprozessen, welche in Zukunft zu einem besseren Verst\"andnis der Dissipationsmechanismen im Grenzreibungsbereich beitragen kann.},

  abstract = {We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the frictional response of monolayers of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate and hemicylindrical aggregates physisorbed on gold. Our simulations of a sliding spherical asperity reveal the following two friction regimes: at low loads, the films show Amonton's friction with a friction force that rises linearly with normal load, and at high loads, the friction force is independent of the load as long as no direct solid--solid contact occurs. The transition between these two regimes happens when a single molecular layer is confined in the gap between the sliding bodies. The friction force at high loads on a monolayer rises monotonically with film density and drops slightly with the transition to hemicylindrical aggregates. This monotonous increase of friction force is compatible with a traditional plowing model of sliding friction. At low loads, the friction coefficient reaches a minimum at the intermediate surface concentrations. We attribute this behavior to a competition between adhesive forces, repulsion of the compressed film, and the onset of plowing.},

Its modular design enables it to serve a wide variety of usages, from a multimedia digital object repository, to a web journal, to a fully functional digital library. The development strategy used to implement Invenio ensures it is flexible in any layer. Being based on open standards such as MARCXML and OAI-PMH 2.0 its interoperability with other digital libraries is guaranteed. Being originally designed to cope with the CERN requirements for digital object management, Invenio is suitable for middle-to-large scale digital repositories (100K\textasciitilde 10M records). Records can be of any nature (e.g. papers, books, photos, videos). This presentation will introduce the different features of Invenio, their usage in the CERN context and how other institutions and projects are also driving some of its development.},

The author offers insights with regard to ideas, old and new, about science, and their historical origins in philosophy and sociology of science, which is of interest to a broad readership. The book shows that scientifically grounded knowledge is required and helpful in understanding intellectual and political positions in various discussions on the grand challenges of our time and how science makes impact on society. The book reveals why interventions that look good or even obvious, are often met with resistance and are hard to realize in practice. Based on a thorough analysis, as well as personal experiences in aids research, university administration and as a science observer, the author provides - while being totally open regarding science's limitations- a realistic narrative about how research is conducted, and how reliable `objective' knowledge is produced. His idea of science, which draws heavily on American pragmatism, fits in with the global Open Science movement. It is argued that Open Science is a truly and historically unique movement in that it translates the analysis of the problems of science into major institutional actions of system change in order to improve academic culture and the impact of science, engaging all actors in the field of science and academia.},

  abstract = {The explosion in volumes and types of data has led to substantial challenges in data management. These challenges are often faced by front-line researchers who are already dealing with rapidly changing technologies and have limited time to devote to data management. There are good high-level guidelines for managing and processing scientific data. However, there is a lack of simple, practical tools to implement these guidelines. This is particularly problematic in a highly distributed research environment where needs differ substantially from group to group and centralised solutions are difficult to implement and storage technologies change rapidly. To meet these challenges we have developed dtool, a command line tool for managing data. The tool packages data and metadata into a unified whole, which we call a dataset. The dataset provides consistency checking and the ability to access metadata for both the whole dataset and individual files. The tool can store these datasets on several different storage systems, including a traditional file system, object store (S3 and Azure) and iRODS. It includes an application programming interface that can be used to incorporate it into existing pipelines and workflows. The tool has provided substantial process, cost, and peace-of-mind benefits to our data management practices and we want to share these benefits. The tool is open source and available freely online at http://dtool.readthedocs.io.},

  abstract = {The optimization of surface finish to improve performance occurs largely through trial and error, despite significant advancements in the relevant science. There are three central challenges that account for this disconnect: (1) the challenge of integration of many different types of measurement for the same surface to capture the multi-scale nature of roughness; (2) the technical complexity of implementing spectral analysis methods, and of applying mechanical or numerical models to describe surface performance; (3) a lack of consistency between researchers and industries in how surfaces are measured, quantified, and communicated. Here we present a freely-available internet-based application which attempts to overcome all three challenges. First, the application enables the user to upload many different topography measurements taken from a single surface, including using different techniques, and then integrates all of them together to create a digital surface twin. Second, the application calculates many of the commonly used topography metrics, such as root-mean-square parameters, power spectral density (PSD), and autocorrelation function (ACF), as well as implementing analytical and numerical calculations, such as boundary element modeling (BEM) for elastic and plastic deformation. Third, the application serves as a repository for users to securely store surfaces, and if they choose, to share these with collaborators or even publish them (with a digital object identifier) for all to access. The primary goal of this application is to enable researchers and manufacturers to quickly and easily apply cutting-edge tools for the characterization and properties-modeling of real-world surfaces. An additional goal is to advance the use of open-science principles in surface engineering by providing a FAIR database where researchers can choose to publish surface measurements for all to use.},

However, the role of these instabilities in adhesion hysteresis remains poorly understood because we lack theoretical and numerical models accounting for realistic roughness. Our work focuses on the adhesion of soft elastic spheres with low roughness or weak heterogeneity, where the indentation process can be described as a Griffith-like propagation of a nearly circular external crack. We discuss how to describe the contact of spheres with chemical heterogeneity that leads to fluctuations in the local work of adhesion. We introduce a variational first-order crack-perturbation model and validate our approach using boundary-element simulations. The crack-perturbation model faithfully predicts contact shapes and hysteretic force-penetration curves, provided that the contact perimeter remains close to a circle and the contact area is simply connected. Computationally, the crack-perturbation model is orders of magnitude more efficient than the corresponding boundary element formulation, allowing for realistic heterogeneity fields.},

  abstract = {Insects, pick-and-place manufacturing, engineered adhesives, and soft robots employ soft materials to stick to surfaces even in the presence of roughness. Experiments show that the force required for making contact is lower than for releasing it, a phenomenon known as the adhesion hysteresis. The common explanation for this hysteresis is either contact aging or viscoelasticity. Here, we show that adhesion hysteresis emerges even for perfectly elastic contacts and in the absence of contact aging and viscoelasticity because of surface roughness. We present a crack-perturbation model and experimental observations that reveal discrete jumps of the contact perimeter. These stick-slip instabilities are triggered by local differences in fracture energy between roughness peaks and valleys. Pinning of the contact perimeter retards both its advancement when coming into contact and its retraction when pulling away. Our model quantitatively reproduces the hysteresis observed in experiments and allows us to derive analytical predictions for its magnitude, accounting for realistic rough geometries across orders of magnitude in length scale. Our results explain why adhesion hysteresis is ubiquitous and reveal why soft pads in nature and engineering are efficient in adhering even to surfaces with significant roughness.},

By using Jupyter notebooks that run in a web-browser, the NOMAD data can be queried and accessed; data mining, machine learning, and other AI techniques can be then applied to analyze them. This infrastructure brings the concept of reproducibility in materials science to the next level, by allowing researchers to share not only the data contributing to their scientific publications, but also all the developed methods and analytics tools.

For this, a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data infrastructure is a must. Only then can data be readily shared and explored using data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Making data 'findable and AI ready' (a forward-looking interpretation of the acronym) will change the way in which science is carried out today. In this Perspective, we discuss how we can~prepare to make this happen for the field of materials science.},

  abstract = {Web-version: https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1 This document specifies a method, known as RO-Crate (Research Object Crate), of aggregating and describing research data with associated metadata. RO-Crates can aggregate and describe any resource including files, URI-addressable resources, or use other addressing schemes to locate digital or physical data. RO-Crates can describe data in aggregate and at the individual resource level, with metadata to aid in discovery, re-use and long term management of data. Metadata includes the ability to describe the context of data and the entities involved in its production, use and reuse. For example: who created it, using which equipment, software and workflows, under what licenses can it be re-used, where was it collected, and/or where is it about. RO-Crate uses JSON-LD to to express this metadata using linked data, describing data resources as well as contextual entities such as people, organizations, software and equipment as a series of linked JSON-LD objects - using common published vocabularies, chiefly schema.org. The core of RO-Crate is a JSON-LD file, the RO-Crate Metadata File, named ro-crate-metadata.json. This file contains structured metadata about the dataset as a whole (the Root Data Entity) and, optionally, about some or all of its files. This provides a simple way to, for example, assert the authors (e.g. people, organizations) of the RO-Crate or one its files, or to capture more complex provenance for files, such as how they were created using software and equipment. While providing the formal specification for RO-Crate, this document also aims to be a practical guide for software authors to create tools for generating and consuming research data packages, with explanation by examples.},

  abstract = {The development of an electronic lab notebook (ELN) for researchers working in the field of chemical sciences is presented. The web based application is available as an Open Source software that offers modern solutions for chemical researchers. The Chemotion ELN is equipped with the basic functionalities necessary for the acquisition and processing of chemical data, in particular the work with molecular structures and calculations based on molecular properties. The ELN supports planning, description, storage, and management for the routine work of organic chemists. It also provides tools for communicating and sharing the recorded research data among colleagues. Meeting the requirements of a state of the art research infrastructure, the ELN allows the search for molecules and reactions not only within the user's data but also in conventional external sources as provided by SciFinder and PubChem. The presented development makes allowance for the growing dependency of scientific activity on the availability of digital information by providing Open Source instruments to record and reuse research data. The current version of the ELN has been using for over half of a year in our chemistry research group, serves as a common infrastructure for chemistry research and enables chemistry researchers to build their own databases of digital information as a prerequisite for the detailed, systematic investigation and evaluation of chemical reactions and mechanisms.},
